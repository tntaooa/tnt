\section*{Preface to Second Edition}
It has been over $3$ years since we have written this book. When we read the book now, we sometimes feel kind of silly. In some places, the writing comes off as childish and probably even unprofessional. But we do not regret writing the book that way. There are reasons why we have written it the way we did. We admit that we did not have the enormous amount of patience required to finish the book in a greater style. We were hurried to write a lot of the things back then. Not because we were told to, since this is an independent publication after all. There are a number of factors why we felt hurried to finish the book. For example, the book was already large even though we discarded a lot of the content we had planned for the book. In fact, we discarded most of the content we planned because the book would be so huge not even us would have been interested in reading a book that large. But that messed with our plans a lot since we had to change a lot of things on the fly. The whole reason we wanted to write a book despite there existing a lot of books on number theory is that we wanted our book to contain results or techniques that would not be as common in other Olympiad books. However, even with the minimum amount of content we decided to go with, it still felt like it was getting too large. So we tried to pick up the pace after some chapters. And one of the biggest concerns we had was that if we had not finished the book soon, we might not have been able to finish it at all. Or even worse, we could have forgotten about the whole book altogether (that has happened as well). Anyway, we mention these here not to make any excuses nor do we feel terrible about it. Because even though the end product does not look like the most ideal output right now, we believe this book can still help people, at least some new students who are looking to solve number theory problems. Would the book be a lot better if we rewrote it now? Yes, probably at least ten times better. But we have neither the energy nor the time to do so. There are some updates and error fixes in this edition which hopefully improves at least some aspects of the book.

It is possible there are some \LaTeX\ issues in the new edition. If anyone finds any, please do not hesitate to email us.

\section*{Preface from first edition}

I would like to have a few words before diving into the discussion. First of all, from my personal experience, I have found that there is a common practice to learn by learning a lot of theories and then investigating how those theories are used to solve problems. As our primary audience would be students who are looking to get into mathematical Olympiads, I highly discourage this. Please do not take number theory for a collection of theories just because the word theory is literally juxtaposed with it. That being said, one could say that our book itself is a collection of a lot of theorems as well. Sadly, that is partially true for multiple reasons even though it was not our intention at all.


When I first thought about writing this book, my intention was to make students realize that they do not need to know a lot of theorems in order to be able to solve problems. My primary target was to build confidence about this claim. But as we kept writing we had to increase the pace since we had to cover a lot (and that was  discarding a lot of contents which we thought would ask for even discussion or we just felt lazy about it), we had to increase the pace.


I would like to address one more concern. Originally, my plan was to make this book a series of $5$ volumes, this being the first one. In those volumes I wanted to discuss a lot of topics such as special numbers like \textit{egyptian fraction} or even interesting numbers like \textit{abundant number or deficient number} and their properties etc or crucial topics such as \textit{Diophantine equations}. You will notice that we have left a lot of important topics like those out of this book. The reason is, I quickly realized I can hardly finish writing this first volume, and if I wanted to complete the series we will probably have to keep writing my whole life. So, I had to discard a lot of contents and make the book concise which resulted in squeezing in a lot of contents in a few hundreds of pages.


Finally, I would like to thank Amir to join me in this project. At one point I stopped writing the book. If he had not agreed to be a co-author, this book would have probably not been completed at all. More so because he agreed to follow the style I wanted to write in even when we had objection from reputed publisher like \textit{Springer}.

\newpage

In the past three years, we have been always worried about this book. It's been a long and tedious job to manage everything and edit all we had written a very long time ago. After I studied higher level number theory concepts, there were times that I found errors/typos in my previous drafts for the book. And that sometimes happened two or more times in a short period, and so, it was getting annoying. Anyhow, we managed to finish it at this time of the summer. It is now 5:36 AM, Tuesday, July 17, 2018 that I'm writing this. You can imagine how crazy this process has made me!

\vspace{0.3cm}
Many of our friends helped us during the way to finish this book, as mentioned in the acknowledgment, and we are so proud to have such friends. I wouldn't be able to finish my part in this book if I didn't have the support of my wonderful, beautiful, and lovely wife \textbf{Nadia Ghobadipasha}. She gave me hope to choose mathematics and always believed in me. She was my only one in the hardest days of life.

\vspace{0.3cm}

Professor \textbf{Peyman Nasehpour}, whom I knew from the very first semester of my undergraduate studies in electrical engineering at University of Tehran, helped me a lot in the process of enhancing my mathematical abilities to change my field to mathematics (number theory) for my master's.  He is an inspiration to me, and a great colleague when it comes to teamwork. I'm looking forward to working with him more often.

The idea behind the lattices in the \textbf{cover} is a geometric proof of law of quadratic reciprocity. Our friends found other interpretations of it such as Pick's theorem (which is not the case here) or the sum of positive integers up to $n$, which you will realize is also not always true (for all primes $p,q$). Section \eqref{sec:qrlawproof} is dedicated to this proof and investigates why it is true using counting the lattice (grid) points. When we picked this idea for the cover, we chose quadratic reciprocity because its proof is geometrically visual and indeed very beautiful. Our hope was to make the reader curious because the design looks familiar. Stay excited until you read that proof! Or, maybe, go read it if you have the prerequisite knowledge and the puzzle is boggling your mind. I remember I found the idea of the proof in one of Kenneth H. Rosen's books on discrete mathematics, but I'm not sure which one, as it was a long time ago when I wrote it. I used TikZ package for \LaTeX to write the codes and generate the graphs.

There are so many wonderful things to learn in this book. I hope you enjoy it!
