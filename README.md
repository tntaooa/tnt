# IMPORTANT #
* Work on your branch only
* If on master or other branch, pull before you do anything
* When your changes are made and you have completed a milestone, push it to your branch
* Create a pull request
* Merge with master after the work is done
* Masum will approve it and delete the branch
* Create e branch for yourself every time you work, that should be the best option
* Don't edit any file that is out of scope
* It's best for two persons to not edit the same thing at the same time.

## Structure ##
* Book document class
* Use of subfiles
* Write or edit in your own branch. When done, push it.
* Create a pull request when you feel it should be merged.
* You can create a new issue if you face any problem or there is a suggestion.


## Make Changes ##
* Notice the import of files in a .tex file using \subfile{file.tex}
* Edit only those which are relevant and in your file.
* For example, in intro.tex, there is only one subfile idthm.tex for now.
