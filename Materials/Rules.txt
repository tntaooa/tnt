when moving to a new environment, alway indent

Amir Hossein Parvardi, [08.07.16 00:49]
let me give you some examples

Amir Hossein Parvardi, [08.07.16 00:49]
suppose that you have started a new section

Amir Hossein Parvardi, [08.07.16 00:50]
\section{blahblah}
      hello, this is text, indented

Amir Hossein Parvardi, [08.07.16 00:50]
use a tab to indent

Amir Hossein Parvardi, [08.07.16 00:50]
and then you want to pose a theorem

Amir Hossein Parvardi, [08.07.16 00:51]
\section{blahblah}
      hello, this is text, indented
            \begin{theorem}
                  theorem statement
            \end{theorem}
      rest of the text

Amir Hossein Parvardi, [08.07.16 00:51]
this is the correct form of indenting

Amir Hossein Parvardi, [08.07.16 00:57]
the other thing is labeling

Amir Hossein Parvardi, [08.07.16 00:59]
use this formatting

Labels:
Proposition: \label{prop:Name}
theorem: \label{thm:TheoremName}
problem: \label{prob:Name}
lemma: \label{thm:LemmaName}
chapter: \label{ch:TheoremName}
section: \label{sec:NameName}
example: \label{ex:TheoremName}
corollary: \label{cor:Name}
definition: \label{def:Name}
Identity: \label{id:Name}
Equation: \label{eq:Name}

Amir Hossein Parvardi, [08.07.16 01:00]
when you are writing a proof, be sure to put a white line before \end{proof}

Amir Hossein Parvardi, [08.07.16 01:00]
that is, it should look like this:

    \begin{proof}
        Here is the proof.
        
    \end{proof}

Amir Hossein Parvardi, [08.07.16 01:00]
this way the square at the end of the proof goes to the next line and is more beautiful :D

Amir Hossein Parvardi, [08.07.16 01:01]
please use \slshape for writing theorems

Amir Hossein Parvardi, [08.07.16 01:01]
this is how you should use it:

\begin{theorem}\slshape
    Theorem
\end{theorem}

Amir Hossein Parvardi, [08.07.16 01:01]
any questions by now?

Amir Hossein Parvardi, [08.07.16 01:03]
for centering equations, please avoid using \[ \] or $$ $$

Amir Hossein Parvardi, [08.07.16 01:03]
use this formatting instead:

Amir Hossein Parvardi, [08.07.16 01:04]
\begin{align*}
      blah blah &= more blah\\
                        &= even more\\
                        &=enough.
\end{align*}

Amir Hossein Parvardi, [08.07.16 01:05]
this is an example produced by align

Amir Hossein Parvardi, [08.07.16 01:06]
if you ever want to number the lines of your formula, use align instead of align*

Amir Hossein Parvardi, [08.07.16 01:07]
for example:

\begin{align}
      blah blah &= more blah\\
                        &= numbered formula \label{eq:hojor1}\\
                        &=enough.
\end{align}

Amir Hossein Parvardi, [08.07.16 01:07]
[In reply to Amir Hossein Parvardi]
this will number the second line of your equation
as you see, i have kept the formatting for the label

Amir Hossein Parvardi, [08.07.16 01:08]
you can use eqnarray* and eqnarray as well

Amir Hossein Parvardi, [08.07.16 01:08]
Use \nmid instead of \not|

Amir Hossein Parvardi, [08.07.16 01:09]
For three dots, if you have something like a sequence use \ldots: $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ and if you have a product or sum, use \cdots: $a_1+a_2+\cdots+a_n$.

Amir Hossein Parvardi, [08.07.16 01:09]
aha, and to refer to something (a theorem, lemma, definition, fornula etc), please use \eqref{label}

Amir Hossein Parvardi, [08.07.16 01:11]
it is conventional to use \eqref only for equations and \ref for theorems, lemmas, etc
but we like \eqref more and we used it in all kind of reference (either theorems, lemmas, etc or equations)

Amir Hossein Parvardi, [08.07.16 01:12]
to give a special name to a theorem, lemma, definition, etc simply use [the name]

Amir Hossein Parvardi, [08.07.16 01:12]
for example

Amir Hossein Parvardi, [08.07.16 01:12]
\begin{theorem}[theorem's name] \slshape
    Theorem
\end{theorem}

Amir Hossein Parvardi, [08.07.16 01:14]
when you want to introduce something (no difference what it is: the name of a mathematician, a special function, etc) for the first time, use \textit{name} to make it italic

Amir Hossein Parvardi, [08.07.16 01:14]
example:

\textit{Bertrand's postulate} is a very nice and influential theorem in number theory. \textit{Joseph Bertrand} first conjectured it, but he couldn't prove it entirely.
